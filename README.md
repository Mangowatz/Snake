Not sure why this was such a hard thing for me to find but I orginally wanted to write an AI for snake. Something that wouldn't be too complex. Turns out it's complex.
So I started making my own Snake game (orginal code bassed off CodingWithTim) and made a few basic algorithms so get the train moving. 
There are three basic algorithims currently running: 
V0: manual - control with WASD
V1: align x&y coordinates of snake head to food
V2: V1 but more concise 
V3: V2 with immediate obstical avoidance
V4: (not completed yet) Full redesign using pathfinder algorithim
V5: neural net

All of these can be found is src/autLogic

I will try to update this as time goes on
